## Backstory
Several years ago I made a Dark Souls themed hangman game using JS/JQuery. It was my favorite project I did as I was learning web development skills back in 2018. Now I'm coming back to the same project but with five years of professional experience. Feel free to contrast it with my Dark Souls game to judge how far I've come as a developer. 

## Tech
React 18, SASS and JavaScript. This was also a nice chance to try out the use-sound package to add sounds to my reactive elements. 

## Try it yourself!
The game is currently hosted(ragepanda.github.io/hangman-2) if you're curious to see it. If you do decide to check it out, please share your thoughts!
